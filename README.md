# ReactJS Star Wars Dashboard

## Introduction

Welcome to the ReactJS Star Wars Dashboard project! This project aims to create a responsive and visually appealing dashboard where users can explore information about different content types in the Star Wars universe. The dashboard includes categories such as Films, People, Planets, Species, Starships, and Vehicles.

## Dashboard Overview

### Categories:

1. **Films:**
   - Display Star Wars films in a grid or list view.
   - Each film has a title, a poster image, and a release date.

2. **People:**
   - Display important people in the Star Wars universe in a list or grid view.
   - Each person has a name, birthdate, and species.

3. **Planets:**
   - Display planets in the Star Wars universe in a list or grid view.
   - Each planet has a name, climate, and gravity.

4. **Species:**
   - Display species in the Star Wars universe in a list or grid view.
   - Each species has a name, homeworld, and lifespan.

5. **Starships:**
   - Display starships in the Star Wars universe in a list or grid view.
   - Each starship has a name, model, and hyperdrive rating.

6. **Vehicles:**
   - Display vehicles in the Star Wars universe in a list or grid view.
   - Each vehicle has a name, model, and top speed.

### User Interaction:

- Clicking on a resource element opens a sidebar displaying detailed information.

### Design:

- Micro-interactions and hovers for enhanced user experience.
- Utilizes placeholder images from [picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos/) or allows users to add their own images.

### API:

- Uses the [SWAPI API](https://swapi.dev/) to fetch data for different content types.

### Issues:

- API response from Swapi may be slow / unresponsive at times. 
- Although the project is responsive, it hasn't been tested on a large array of devices, certain devices may face unresponsive design.
